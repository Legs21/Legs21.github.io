## Project Proposal

<b>Project Plan</b>  

<b>Vision Statment:</b> This project will allow me to create and display ArcGIS layers and maps on a website that I create. This is exactly the career field that I am hoping to break into after this degree as an GIS Developer. I could just focus on the GIS aspect, but I also really want to refine my skills building websites and creating platforms to host this information.  

<b>Motivation:</b> As described in the vision statement, this is the field I am oping to break into post graduation. Cataloging my backcountry travels is also something I am very passionate about, which gives me extra reason to want  to see it through to completion and do it well.  

<b>Goals:</b> I want to develop hands on skills with GIS, and specifically ArcGIS. I want to continue to refine my skills with node.js as that is a very popular language across many industries. Finally, I want to practice making a UI/UX that is engaging to interact with.

<b>Risks:</b> I have not completed an entire project in node.js or with ArcGIS before. I have done skill building and small scale creations in both, but never put something fully together. The good nes is that I have a student acount to ArcGIS that gives me full access to all of it's capabilities, as well as ESRI's training modules should I need assistance with something in particular.

<b>Evaluations:</b> I will know my project is done when I can see my backcountry trips displayed on my site. I will also be able to log into my site and upload data that will show up on the map and in the catalog automatically, that way I don't have to mess with the site itself, but can just update the database housing the information displayed on the site.
